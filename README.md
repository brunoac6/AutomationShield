# AutomationShield
Project

Driven by the need to promptly test different control algorithms in minuaturized plants, arduino-shield-like boards can be created to fulfill such need. Based on the work developed by [Gergely Tak√°cs](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield), a thermal plant was developed for such purpose.

The Temperature Shield is comprised of a temperature sensor, a heating element and a cooling element. It's breadboard version can be seen below.
